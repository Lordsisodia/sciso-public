# SISO Client Base - Master Plan
*Word-for-word documentation of core strategy*

## Overview
The general gist of the Client Base is that we've already done a lot of work on it, and that's why we don't want to lose it in the client base folder.

## Landing Page System
- Multiple landing pages for different clients
- Different links for different clients
- Affiliates can give different links to clients
- Each client gets their own custom landing page

## Core User Flow
### Immediate Dashboard Access
- People go right onto the dashboard - **no login, nothing**
- You just go right onto the dashboard immediately

### Onboarding Process
The dashboard goes through certain onboarding steps for the client:
- Collecting all the information we need from them about their project
- Information gathering happens gradually, bit by bit
- **Slightly gamified** in the way it's unlocked
- Designed so clients feel like they're getting something as they progress

## Information Collection Strategy
We collect comprehensive information including:
- What they want the app to be
- Help them build out the specs
- What types of UI they like
- All project requirements and preferences

## Future AI Integration
- Eventually, maybe we have an AI which builds it with them
- Clients can see live updates of their project being built
- Real-time collaboration between client and AI

## Core Purpose
The whole point of the client base: **helping sort out all the interaction with the clients**
- Contract signing processes
- Payment collection
- Basic communications
- All client-facing interactions

## Communication Features
- Chat function built into the app
- Real-time messaging system
- Client support and updates

## Platform Strategy
### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Downloaded as a PWA
- Clients have this as an app on their phone
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile

### Device Usage Pattern
- **Desktop**: Required for most functionality
- **Mobile**: Primarily for communications
- Cross-platform synchronization

## Strategic Goal
**Everything client-facing should be built out on this app** - this is the central hub for all client interactions and project management.
