- **Bug Reduction:** -50% production issues
- **Developer Experience:** +40% satisfaction improvement
- **Deployment Frequency:** Enable daily deployments

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Data Loss/Corruption**
   - **Mitigation:** Database migration testing, backup procedures
   - **Probability:** Low (read-only migration)

2. **Feature Regression**
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout
   - **Probability:** Medium (complex state management)

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Mitigation:** Bundle analysis, performance monitoring
   - **Probability:** Low (expected improvement)

### Medium Risks
1. **Team Adoption Challenges**
   - **Mitigation:** Training, documentation, mentoring
   - **Probability:** Medium

2. **Build Pipeline Issues**
   - **Mitigation:** Gradual transition, fallback builds
   - **Probability:** Low
