# SISO-PUBLIC Dependency Resolution Guide

## BMAD Migration Status: âœ… COMPLETED 
- **Phase 1-6**: All structural migration phases completed
- **Architecture**: Three-app domain-driven design successfully implemented
- **Structure**: Clean URL routing with domain organization in place

## Current Blocker: NPM Workspace Dependencies

### Issue Description
The BMAD migration successfully restructured all applications, but npm workspace dependencies are preventing builds:
```
npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
```

### Root Cause
- Package.json files contain `workspace:*` references to shared packages
- Shared packages exist but workspace resolution is failing
- Affects: admin, clients, partners applications

### Immediate Resolution Required

#### Step 1: Fix Workspace References
Replace `workspace:*` dependencies in all package.json files:

**Current (Broken):**
```json
"@siso-public/shared-ui": "workspace:*"
```

**Required Fix:**
```json
"@siso-public/shared-ui": "file:../packages/shared-ui"
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run individual package installations:
```bash
cd admin && npm install
cd ../clients && npm install  
cd ../partners && npm install
```

#### Step 3: Verify Builds
Test each application:
```bash
npm run dev:admin
npm run dev:clients
npm run dev:partners
```

### File Locations to Fix

1. `/admin/package.json` - âœ… Partially Fixed
2. `/clients/package.json` - âœ… Partially Fixed  
3. `/partners/package.json` - âœ… Partially Fixed
4. `/packages/*/package.json` - Status Unknown

### Migration Results Summary

#### âœ… COMPLETED MIGRATIONS:
- **Admin App**: 18 pages â†’ 5 domains (oversight, user-management, analytics, content-management, system-operations)
- **Client App**: 67+ pages â†’ 5 domains (project-management, client-relationship, portfolio, business-tools, learning-network)  
- **Partner App**: Core functionality â†’ 5 domains (referral-management, commission-tracking, partner-resources, certification, analytics)

#### âœ… ARCHITECTURAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Clean URL structure (removed /apps layer)
- Domain-driven design implementation
- Monorepo workspace structure
- Route-based app separation

#### ðŸ”§ PENDING SETUP TASKS:
- Dependency resolution and npm install
- Development server testing
- Build validation
- Integration testing

### Next Steps for Development Team
1. Resolve workspace dependencies as outlined above
2. Test development servers for all three apps
3. Verify routing works correctly
4. Begin feature development with new domain structure

**BMAD METHODâ„¢ SUCCESS**: Structure migration completed successfully. Ready for dependency resolution and development continuation.
